An Android application using Kotlin. The app simulates a movie application where we can choose between different movies and see information about them, including the movie poster, images from the movie, trailer, reviews, and age rating. Additionally, we can book tickets for the selected movie from various cinemas. We can use the app as a guest or log in as a user, and when logged in as a user, we can leave reviews for different movies. We can leave a complaint/feedback to customer service with the click of a button, and finally, as an admin, we can upload new movies ourselves. The app uses Firebase and is written in Kotlin.
